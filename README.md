## **Technical Upgrades — *Rafsan’s Edition**

###  Keras 3.0 Migration
- Fully refactored to support **TensorFlow / Keras 2.16+**
- Resolved legacy `batch_input_shape` serialization issues
- Re-linked model weights to a **native Keras 3 architecture**

### 🧠 Neural Engine Optimization:
- Faster inference with optimized model loading
- Clean separation between preprocessing, inference, and UI layers

### Cyber-Lab Interface:
- Complete UI overhaul with **Glassmorphism**
- Monospace typography for a **research console aesthetic**
- Animated scanning effects and real-time prediction feedback

### 📊 Dynamic Analysis Matrix
- Real-time probability tracking
- Automated “scanning” animation during inference
